Hey Guys! Glad you are here using the CN language!

To use the language, check out our design doc:

Basically, replace the highlevelauthordescription object in debiasing2.js with your story descriptions and create all scene specifications following our templete (the scene object). Pack all your scene objects into a list and replace the scene_array field of the highlevelauthordescription with an array of your scene specifications.

To run the program, call meteor in the command line.

You may have to log in to Cerebro system in order to use it.

Author interface under construction. Wait patiently for it!
