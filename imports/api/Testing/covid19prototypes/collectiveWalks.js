     * Obstacles;
     * (1) I want to take multiple pictures and participate multiple times.
     * (2) I want to be taken to a dynamic participate screen to input my affordance?
     *    Or do something similar to Cast... I guess the in the moment label is fine, although it kinda
     *    defeats the point.
